In the "Prefabs" there are two prefabs
 - Default Panel
 - Side Wall
 
 
 Default Panel is used as silhouette of a single panel.
 You just need to input the "Panel Size" you get from the bonds and the panel should resize appropriately
 Stripe thickness is the thickness of the bright stripes between panels. They help hide seams in case there are some
 
 
 If the panel you're replacing with the default is a Start/End, you need to use a "Side Wall" prefab as a direct child of a Default Panel
 The Side Wall should resize automatically from the Panel Size of the parent, you just need to specify if it is a left or right wall
